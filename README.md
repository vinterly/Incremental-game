# Incremental game

A simple incremental game called A Tiny Village. Currently written in HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

The basis of this game has been written following the tutorial by Reddit user YhvrTheSecond (https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/ahf6nx/how_to_make_an_incremental_game/). The game is being developed parallel to my computer science degree. As such, it will be expanded upon as I learn new stuff. The languages used may thus change during its development.
